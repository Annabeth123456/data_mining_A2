# Classification Assignment

## Overview
This project involves building a classification model to analyze user data, predict outcomes, and generate insights. The assignment is designed to evaluate your ability to preprocess data, develop a classification model, evaluate its performance, and report the results.

---

## Objectives
1. **Impute Missing Labels**:
   - Predict and fill missing target labels in the provided test dataset (`Test.csv`).

2. **Build and Evaluate a Classification Model**:
   - Implement one or more classification models using the training and validation datasets.
   - Evaluate model performance on both the validation and test datasets.

3. **Deliverables**:
   - A report summarizing:
     - The implemented model(s).
     - Evaluation results and performance metrics.
     - Key observations and conclusions.

---

## Data Description
### Dataset Details
The dataset consists of:
- **Training Set**: Used for training the classification model.
- **Validation Set**: Used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate interim performance.
- **Test Set**: Contains missing target labels that need to be imputed as part of the assignment.

### Special Notes:
- Many attributes may have a value of `"nan"`, indicating missing or unavailable data.

## Deliverables
### 1. **Classification Results**
- Imputed target labels for the test dataset (`Test.csv`).

### 2. **Assignment Report**
The report must include:
1. **Model Implementation**:
   - Details of the selected model(s) and the rationale for their choice.
   - Description of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and any techniques used for handling missing data.
   - Explanation of hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques.

2. **Evaluation Results**:
   - Performance metrics for the validation and test datasets.
   - Include additional metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, or Confusion Matrix if applicable.

3. **Key Observations and Conclusions**:
   - Insights from the modeling process.
   - Interpretation of model results and any limitations or challenges encountered.

4. **Deadline**:
   - **Submission Date**: December 8, 2024 (End of the day).

## Recommended Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Analyze feature distributions and correlations.
   - Normalize or encode features if required.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Experiment with different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
   - Use cross-validation or a validation set to optimize hyperparameters.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance on both validation and test datasets.
   - Compare multiple models if applicable and select the best-performing one.

4. **Report Preparation**:
   - Clearly describe methods, results, and conclusions.
   - Use visualizations (e.g., ROC curves, bar charts) to support findings.

---

## Notes
- You are free to choose any programming language or framework (e.g., Python, R) for this project.
- Focus on clarity and reproducibility in your code and report.

---

## Submission Requirements
- **Imputed Test Dataset**: Submit the `Test.csv` file with predicted labels filled in.
- **Assignment Report**: A comprehensive document detailing the implementation, evaluation, and conclusions.
